# Animeasy Tools E-commerce Site

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the ecommerce app, including its purpose, features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contact information.

## Purpose
The purpose of the ecommerce app is to provide users with a platform to browse, purchase, and manage digital products online. It aims to streamline the shopping experience for customers and simplify product management for sellers.
Animation is a costly and time consuming business. With the advent of digital animation it is largely created using computer programmes. This means that professionals can browse the web for plugins that may help them. 
In my animation career, I starte out using plugins purchased or developed by the studio, but over time I started to develop my own for more specific uses.

### Product browsing: Enable users to search, filter, and view products.
### Shopping cart: Allow users to add and remove items from their cart.
### Checkout process: Guide users through a secure checkout process.
### Order management: Enable users to track their orders and view order history.
### Seller dashboard: Provide sellers with tools to manage products, orders, and inventory.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
